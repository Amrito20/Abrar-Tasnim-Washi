# ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Upload to GitHub
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (name it something like `portfolio` or `abrar-portfolio`)
2. Upload all files from this folder to the repository
3. Make sure all files are in the root directory of the repository

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository **Settings** tab
2. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
3. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
4. Choose **main** (or **master**) branch
5. Select **/ (root)** folder
6. Click **Save**

### 3. Access Your Website
- Your website will be available at: `https://your-username.github.io/repository-name`
- It may take 5-10 minutes for changes to appear
- GitHub will show you the URL in the Pages settings

### 4. Add Required Images
Before the website is fully functional, add these images to `assets/images/`:
- `profile.jpg` - Professional headshot (350x350px)
- `about.jpg` - Additional photo (350x400px)
- `favicon.ico` - Browser icon (optional)

### 5. Update URLs (Optional)
If you want to update the Open Graph URLs for social media sharing:
1. Open `index.html`
2. Find the `<meta property="og:url"` line
3. Replace with your actual GitHub Pages URL
